# Live Speech Translation with Seq2Seq Model

In this  project i implement a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to create a translation machine.

## Overview

- **Data Source:** Utilizing a diverse dataset of English and Spanish sentence pairs for training the model.
- **Model Architecture:** Employing an encoder-decoder model with LSTM layers for effective sequence learning.
- **Tokenization and Padding:** Preprocessing steps to tokenize and pad sequences for model input.
- **Training:** Training the model on the prepared data to enable accurate translation predictions.
- **Inference:** Applying the trained model to perform translations on new input sentences.
