# Live Speech Translation with Seq2Seq Model

Welcome to Live Speech Translation, a project that uses a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to provide real-time translation between English and Spanish. This project is designed to make language translation more accessible, efficient, and dynamic.

## Overview

- **Data Source:** Utilizing a diverse dataset of English and Spanish sentence pairs for training the model.
- **Model Architecture:** Employing an encoder-decoder model with LSTM layers for effective sequence learning.
- **Tokenization and Padding:** Preprocessing steps to tokenize and pad sequences for model input.
- **Training:** Training the model on the prepared data to enable accurate translation predictions.
- **Inference:** Applying the trained model to perform translations on new input sentences.
